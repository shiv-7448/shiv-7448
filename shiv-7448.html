            <h2 style="color:white">DELL</h2>"> 
                <img style="heigt=600px", width="400px" src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dell-xps-13-2020-01-3-2-3-2-2.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1" alt="Dell XPS 13 Plus">
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Dell’s work, particularly in the Ultrabook field, has yielded an incredible new crop of powerful ultraportable laptops with excellent battery life. Dell’s machines are a great choice if you need a PC for work or school and want it to last for as long as possible. And Dell has arguably one of the best selections of business laptops in its Latitude 7430 line. These models offer a solid design and multiday battery life.
</p>
				

<p style="color:white">This is especially true with its XPS models, which do everything to a high standard. They have the latest high-resolution screens, connections, and software, as well as innovative materials. The XPS 13 is no exception, now with two versions. One, the XPS 13 9315, offers modern styling, an excellent build, and good performance at a lower price. The XPS 13 Plus is the innovator, with a hidden haptic touchpad, an edge-to-edge keyboard, and LED function buttons. For those who like larger screens, the 17-inch XPS 17 is one of our favorite 17-inch laptops.

And Dell isn’t resting on its laurels. Its XPS 15 and XPS 17 remain excellent laptops, albeit with Intel’s previous-generation 12th-gen Alder Lake CPUs. Existing XPS models are some of our favorite laptops ever, ticking just about every box you can think of. Dell models like the Inspiron 14 5000 are some of the most affordable options.

Dell’s laptops look great, offer decent internal hardware, and have heaps of style (and it also offers some of the best ruggedized options on the market). They’re made with premium materials, sport a solid battery life, and are light and portable. Some of Dell’s budget- or business-oriented laptops can be a little lackluster, but in the XPS line, it’s hit after hit.</p>

				<h2 style="color:white">APPLE</h2>">
                  <img style="heigt=600px", width="400px">
				<img style="heigt=600px", width="400px" src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/macbook-pro-2021-15.jpg" alt="Apple Mac Book">
				<p style="color:white">If there’s one thing that nearly everyone agrees on, it’s that Apple laptops are reliable and predictably high-quality. They last a long time, with updates that support older laptops long past when models from other brands have bit the dust. When you buy a MacBook, you know what to expect. You’ll get a fantastic screen, solid battery life, and a beautiful chassis with thin bezels. They do tend to be more expensive than their Windows counterparts, but when it comes to style, ease of use, and reliability, Apple laptops are top-notch.

Apple previously updated the MacBook line with its own faster CPUs and added connectivity while removing the controversial Touch Bar — all without raising prices. From fixing long-acknowledged problems with its keyboard design to shifting its laptops over to its own internal ARM chip, currently the M2 in the MacBook Air and the incredibly fast M2 Pro and M2 Max variants in the MacBook 14 and 16, it’s a great time to be an Apple fan.

                				<h2 style="color:white">HP</h2>">
                  <img style="heigt=600px", width="400px">
				<img style="heigt=600px", width="400px" src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hp-spectre-x360-2022-1-1.jpg" alt="Hp Spectre X360 13.6">
				<p style="color:white">HP may not have always had the best laptop reputation, but the latest laptops from HP have taken some design cues from its contemporaries and have raised the bar. Its current notebooks are fast, powerful, and easier for consumers to adopt for their personal projects. They’re also quite lovely, with a toned-down, gem-cut design adorning the Spectre line and a sleek, modern look to the latest Envy 15. Through it all, HP has earned a reputation for reliable laptops with very competent customer service.

Today, HP is a contender against some of the best laptop manufacturers in the world. Its Spectre x360 stole the show against the Surface Laptop in our head-to-head and continues to impress with HP’s consistent model upgrade philosophy. The OLED version of the Spectre x360 16 and Spectre x360 13.5 provide incredibly bright and vibrant displays that will please creative types and Netflix binge-watchers alike. If you need a thin laptop, be sure to check out the company’s latest Elite Dragonfly line.

Customer support options place HP in the top five of all manufacturers. With options for up to three years of a comprehensive warranty, you can net yourself some serious protection for your new laptop, too.

HP’s laptops may not always steal the show, but the best HP laptops are stronger today than it’s ever been and well worth considering if you want an alternative to some of the above offerings.

				<h2 style="color:white">MICROSOFT</h2>">
                  <img style="heigt=600px", width="400px">
				<img style="heigt=600px", width="400px" src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/surface-pro-8-02.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1" alt="Microsoft Surface">
				<p style="color:white">A decade ago, no one would have thought that Microsoft would be one of the best laptop brands in the world, but today, it has a well-earned spot on this list. After a few iterations of Surface tablets with some reliability issues, the latest crop can go toe-to-toe with the best laptops from Dell, HP, and Apple.

Microsoft’s Surface Pro 9 is one of our favorite 2-in-1s right now. Microsoft also updated its hardware lineup ahead of the launch of Windows 11. Newest to the list is the Surface Laptop Studio, which replaces the Surface Book for creative professionals, while the Surface Pro 9 mentioned above is a significant upgrade that adds refinement and polish at a cost.

Even more midrange devices like the Surface Laptop 5 (with both 13- and 15-inch versions) and a budget tablet like the Surface Go 3 help bolster Microsoft as one of the best laptop brands today.

The company also offers a standard one-year warranty for Surface products should new owners run into trouble, along with 90 days of free technical support. If you are more interested in a tablet-like 2-in-1 for professional purposes, Microsoft has also integrated a 5G model into the Surface Pro 9 lineup, providing an alternative to the iPad Pro, with more connection options and a Windows 11 on an ARM chip.

Not all Surface devices are fantastic, and their prices tend to escalate very fast as you choose higher specs, but they’re still some of the best task-oriented laptops on the market.

				<h2 style="color:white">ASUS</h2>">
                  <img style="heigt=600px", width="400px">
				<img style="heigt=600px", width="400px" src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/asus-zenbook-pro-16x-2.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1" alt="Asus Zenbook">
				<p style="color:white">Asus laptops might not often take the top spot in our best-of lists, but they usually warrant place high up thanks to their fantastic all-around capabilities. The current crop of its laptops includes thin and light Zenbooks, affordable Chromebooks, and powerful gaming machines like the incredible 2023 ROG Zephyrus G14. And as much as anyone, Asus is leading the movement to tiny bezels that pack as much laptop as possible into the smallest chassis.

For the savvy consumer who favors attractive and distinct-looking tech, look no further than the Asus Zenbook S 13 OLED. This laptop features a beautiful OLED screen and an AMD Ryzen 7 6800U CPU for astounding performance in such a tiny laptop. There are other stellar choices in the Asus family, including the ZenBook Pro 16X, which provides an innovative keyboard design and outstanding performance, and the ZenBook Pro 14 Duo OLED, which features not just one, but two outstanding displays. Both of those laptops feature slim bezels, powerful performance, and well-built chassis.

Asus has also been bold with experimenting with new designs, and it’s one of the earlier companies to give its own take on laptops with two screens, but in a more traditional form factor that we know today.

Asus strongly resembles David in the story of David and Goliath. The lesser-known company continues to stack up against giants like Dell, HP, and Apple. It makes reliable laptops at genuinely affordable prices — and the company takes it a step further by adding yearlog accident- and spill-protection warranties for free.
